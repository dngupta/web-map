# Building a simple web map with Leaflet


For a full description of what is web mapping and basics of maps on the Web, have a look at the chapter in the Open Digital Archaeology Textbook and Environment: https://o-date.github.io/draft/book/what-is-web-mapping.html

This repo supports the exercise described in that chapter.
